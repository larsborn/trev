DESCRIPTION
    trev tries to be sort of a mini-shell focusing on taskwarrior reviewing.

    This script reads a list of pending taskwarrior (http://taskwarrior.org/) tasks and
    presents them to the user one at a time, prompting for an action --among a restricted
    set of taskwarrior commands; this action (or none) is performed on the task, whereupon
    the script proceeds to the next task up to the end of the list.

    At the script prompt the user can also include the current into a set of selected
    tasks which is continously shown. Tasks into this set are marked by taskwarrior as
    active or with a certain tag chosen by the user.

    List comes from a system call to task, obeying then the user preferred settings for
    visibility, order, decoration...
